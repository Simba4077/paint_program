Help/resources used:  

1. All lecture videos in asg1 youtube playlist to complete necessary requirements minus the painting/draw function  
2. Chat GPT for additional "awesome" features:  

"how can i add alpha/transparency option to a canvas in html/js"  
"how can i tailor that feature to how my code is set up right now: <code>"  
"i also want to make a button that replays the drawings that were made (points in the array), how could i do that? do i just clear the canvas and add a delay and re-render the points in the array"  
  
Here is my GPT chatlog:

What's Awesome:  
1. Add an undo button  
2. Added a replay button that clears the canvas and redraws your drawing (all the points in the array currently with a 20ms delay between)  
3. Added a transparency/alpha slider
